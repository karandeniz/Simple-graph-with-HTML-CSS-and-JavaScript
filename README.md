# Introduction

Hi! Welcome to this code. I will be explaining how the code functions. But what did I use it for. Well I used it on my job at CrowdCreate where I created a website so you can keep track of everything you have. Working on that project was a bit tough, but working on the graph was for me really fun. I enjoyed making this alot. Now back to the function of the code, if you paste this in your IDE or your text editor of choise, you might get something like this:

Pretty cool right? Now lets get to the interesting part: How the code works.
